    @brief This is a part of the Parallel Partitioned Multi-physical Simu-
    lation Framework provides FEniCS v2019.1.0 <-> MUI v1.0 <-> OpenFOAM v6 
    two-way coupling.

    Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid domain in OpenFOAM
    Structure dynamics equations for structure domain in FEniCS.

    structureFSIRun.py is the main function of the structure code 
    located in the caseSetup/structureDomain sub-folder
