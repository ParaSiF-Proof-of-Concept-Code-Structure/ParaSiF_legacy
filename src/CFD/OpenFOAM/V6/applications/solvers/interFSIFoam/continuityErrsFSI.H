    @brief This is a part of the Parallel Partitioned Multi-physical Simu-
    lation Framework provides FEniCS v2019.1.0 <-> MUI v1.2 <-> OpenFOAM v6
    two-way coupling.

    Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with two fluid by VOF for fluid domain
	in OpenFOAM and Structure dynamics equations for structure domain in FEniCS.
